# Predictive Analytics Projects

Welcome to my collection of predictive analytics projects. This repository is designed to showcase different machine learning and data science techniques applied across various datasets and scenarios. Each subfolder represents an individual project focused on a specific topic or dataset.

## Projects Overview

Below is the list of projects currently included in this repository:

- **[Adult Income Classification](./adult_income_classification)**: This project focuses on predicting whether an individual's income exceeds $50K/year based on census data. It covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model building.

## Work in Progress

This repository is a work in progress, and new projects will be added over time. The aim is to continually expand the collection with diverse datasets and predictive modeling challenges. Keep an eye on this space for updates!

## Contributing

I am always looking to improve and expand the projects in this repository. If you have suggestions, notice any errors, or identify any misuses of data or techniques, please feel free to notify me. You can open an issue in the repository or submit a pull request with your proposed changes.
